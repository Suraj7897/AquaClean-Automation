## 🚀 **Getting Started**  
Follow these steps to set up the **Septic Saviour** system:

---

### **1. Prerequisites**  
- Install **Python 3.x** and necessary libraries.  
- Install **Flask** or **Django** for the web interface.  
- Required libraries for **Machine Learning** and **Sensor Integration**:  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`  
  - `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy` (for database storage)  
- Hardware components including **gas sensors**, **microcontroller** (ESP32, STM32), and **PPE sensors**.

---

### **2. Hardware Setup**  
#### **Gas Sensor Connection**  
- **Gas Sensor** <--> **Microcontroller**  
  - **VCC** → 3.3V  
  - **GND** → GND  
  - **SDA** → SDA Pin  
  - **SCL** → SCL Pin  

#### **PPE Sensor Connection**  
- **Oxygen / BPM Sensors** <--> **Microcontroller**  
  - **Oxygen Sensor Output** → ADC Pin  
  - **BPM Sensor Output** → Digital Pin

---

### **3. Installation**  
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

``bash
git clone https://github.com/Suraj7897/Septic-saviour.git
cd Septic-saviour
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Running the System
Once the setup is complete, run the system to start real-time monitoring:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Start the web server (Flask/Django)
python app.py

# Access the web interface at:
localhost:5000 (or the appropriate port)
5. Machine Learning Integration
The system uses machine learning to predict gas levels based on historical data and real-time measurements. The model can be trained using scikit-learn or other frameworks for enhanced predictions. Ensure that data from the sensors is captured for training the model.
